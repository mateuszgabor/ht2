## Matlab Requirements
- Tensor Toolbox (https://www.tensortoolbox.org/)

## Python requirements
- torch==1.8.1
- torchvision==0.9.1
- numpy==1.16.6
- Matlab Engine (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html)

## Instructions for use
To use our code, Tensor Toolbox and files from `matlab` folder have to be added to MATLAB path. The working examples of compressing VGG-16 and ResNet-50
network are in `decompose_vgg.py` and `decompose_resnet.py` files, respectively.
